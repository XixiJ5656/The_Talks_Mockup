          Mr. Moser, you grew up in the bookstore your mother ran in Texas. Did
          that predispose you to a future career as a Pulitzer Prize winning
          writer?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think that if your father is a dentist, there's a higher chance that
          you're going to become a dentist... I grew up around people who are
          interested in books — but I didn't always want to be a writer. I
          always loved books, but that didn't necessarily mean that I was going
          to do that. If you come from a book-selling background, you work with
          books, but you don't really see how they get written. I think that
          process is something that happened when I was a little bit older, in
          my early twenties, when I discovered two writers that really made me
          want to write: Clarice Lispector and V. S. Naipaul.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What was it about reading them that inspired you to become a writer
          yourself?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Both gave me an idea of the nobility of the writer, the possibilities
          that a writer had for expression and for a role in society. I
          discovered Brazilian writer Clarice Lispector in my Portuguese class
          in college and I was totally ravished by her. I still never really got
          over her, and it’s been 25 years! Her writing has an incredibly
          powerful and aesthetic influence on me. And V. S. Naipaul had an idea
          of the elevation of the writer as well as the duty of the writer to
          society and to self that I hadn't really encountered before, to that
          degree. Both of them are extremely intimidating writers, which I think
          can be dangerous if you start out in your early twenties.
